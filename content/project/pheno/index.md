Compared to spring phenology, autumn phenology trends are less distinct, and the magnitude of changes is smaller. This is partly due to multiple confounding factors influencing end-of-season (EOS) dynamics. This project investigates the relationship between autumn phenology and photosynthesis.

Our findings show that increased photosynthesis does *not* lead to earlier leaf shedding in autumn. While a short-term (inter-annual) relationship exists—likely driven by variations in spring phenology and constrained leaf longevity—this pattern does not hold at decadal scales or across spatial gradients. This challenges the interpretation of a recent study by [Zani et al. (2020)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd8911) on the drivers of autumn phenology.

Rather than being driven by carbon sink saturation (i.e., plants ceasing activity once sufficient carbon has been assimilated), long-term trends in climate and rising CO2 levels enable plants to extend their growing season. This allows them to overcome leaf-longevity constraints, meaning that an earlier leaf-out trend does not necessarily result in earlier leaf-off. Instead, the opposite is observed—both in long-term temporal trends and spatial patterns.
