<br>

for MSc students in Geography and Climate Sciences. Recaps machine learning contents from AGDS 1 and lets students work on four common applications of data-driven modelling on different topics of Geography and Climate Sciences (digital soil modelling, global upscaling, land cover classification, phenology). The course website is [here](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds2_course/). First run in fall semester 2023. Tutorials on the different topics are available online. Two of the tutorials were developed and introduced in class by Koen Hufkens:
