abstract: Tropical forests dominate terrestrial photosynthesis, yet there are major
  contradictions in our understanding due to a lack of field studies, especially outside
  the tropical Americas. A recent field study indicated that West African forests
  have among the highest forests gross primary productivity (GPP) yet observed, contradicting
  models that rank them lower than Amazonian forests. Here, we show possible reasons
  for this data-model mismatch. We found that biometric GPP measurements are on average
  56.3% higher than multiple global GPP products at the study sites. The underestimation
  of GPP largely disappears when a standard photosynthesis model is informed by local
  field-measured values of (a) fractional absorbed photosynthetic radiation (fAPAR),
  and (b) photosynthetic traits. Remote sensing products systematically underestimate
  fAPAR (33.9% on average at study sites) due to cloud contamination issues. The study
  highlights the potential widespread underestimation of tropical forests GPP and
  carbon cycling and hints at the ways forward for model and input data improvement.
