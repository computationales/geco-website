abstract: Plants acclimate to temperature by adjusting their photosynthetic capacity
  over weeks to months. However, most evidence for photosynthetic acclimation derives
  from leaf-scale experiments. Here we address the scarcity of evidence for canopy-scale
  photosynthetic acclimation by examining the correlation between maximum photosynthetic
  rates (Amax,2,000) and growth temperature ($$overlineT_rmair$$) across a range of
  concurrent temperatures and canopy foliage quantity, using data from textgreater200
  eddy covariance sites. We detect widespread thermal acclimation of canopy-scale
  photosynthesis, demonstrated by enhanced Amax,2,000 under higher $$overlineT_rmair$$,
  across flux sites with adequate water availability. A 14-day period is identified
  as the most relevant timescale for acclimation across all sites, with a range of
  12–25 days for different plant functional types. The mean apparent thermal acclimation
  rate across all ecosystems is 0.41 (−0.38–1.04 for 5th–95th percentile range) µmol m−2 s−1 °C−1,
  with croplands showing the largest acclimation rates and grasslands the lowest.
  Incorporating an optimality-based prediction of leaf photosynthetic capacities into
  a biochemical photosynthesis model is shown to improve the representation of thermal
  acclimation. Our results underscore the critical need for enhanced understanding
  and modelling of canopy-scale photosynthetic capacity to accurately predict plant
  responses to warmer growing seasons.
