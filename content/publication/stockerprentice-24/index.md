abstract: Reducing uncertainty in carbon cycle projections relies on reliable representations
  of interactions between the carbon and nutrient cycles. Here, we build on a set
  of principles and hypotheses, funded in established theoretical understanding and
  supported by empirical evidence, to formulate and implement a dynamic model of carbon-nitrogen
  cycle (C-N) interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. The model combines a representation
  of photosynthetic acclimation to the atmospheric environment with implications for
  canopy and leaf N, a representation of functional balance for modelling C allocation
  and growth different tissues, and a representation of plant N uptake based on a
  first principles-informed, simplified description of solute transport in the soil.
  Here, we provide a comprehensive description of the model and its implementation
  and demonstrate the stability and functionality of the model for simulating seasonal
  variations of ecosystem C and N fluxes and pools. This may provide a way forward
  for representing key ecosystem processes related to C and N cycling based on established
  theoretical concepts with strong empirical support.
