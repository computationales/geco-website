abstract: Understanding the role of groundwater in regulating photosynthesis is key
  in land-climate interactions. However, the impact of groundwater on terrestrial
  ecosystem productivity remains poorly understood. Here, we use satellite observations
  of solar-induced fluorescence as a proxy for photosynthesis, together with estimates
  of water table depth (WTD) and aridity as quantified by the annual moisture index
  with reanalysis data, to investigate the relationships between groundwater and photosynthesis.
  Using explainable machine learning (Shapley additive explanations or SHAP), we demonstrate
  that groundwater plays a crucial role in determining the spatial patterns of global
  photosynthesis, with varying importance across different ecosystem types, and that
  this effect is comparable to aridity. We show that in forests across the contiguous
  USA (CONUS), the relative importance of groundwater represents 89% of the effect
  attributed to the moisture index in modulating photosynthesis, and this impact is
  even more pronounced globally (105% relative importance). The relative importance
  of groundwater compared to the moisture index remains substantial in grasslands
  (37%), savannas and shrublands (25%), and croplands (15%) in CONUS. Global analysis
  confirms these trends for grasslands (41%) and croplands (15%) but indicates a 60%
  importance in savannas and shrublands. Our findings highlight the key global role
  of groundwater in driving ecosystem productivity.
