abstract: Plant water uptake from the soil is a crucial element of the global hydrological
  cycle and essential for vegetation drought resilience. Yet, knowledge of how the
  distribution of water uptake depth (WUD) varies across species, climates, and seasons
  is scarce relative to our knowledge of aboveground plant functions. With a global
  literature review, we found that average WUD varied more among biomes than plant
  functional types (i.e. deciduous/evergreen broadleaves and conifers), illustrating
  the importance of the hydroclimate, especially precipitation seasonality, on WUD.
  By combining records of rooting depth with WUD, we observed a consistently deeper
  maximum rooting depth than WUD with the largest differences in arid regions – indicating
  that deep taproots act as lifelines while not contributing to the majority of water
  uptake. The most ubiquitous observation across the literature was that woody plants
  switch water sources to soil layers with the highest water availability within short
  timescales. Hence, seasonal shifts to deep soil layers occur across the globe when
  shallow soils are drying out, allowing continued transpiration and hydraulic safety.
  While there are still significant gaps in our understanding of WUD, the consistency
  across global ecosystems allows integration of existing knowledge into the next
  generation of vegetation process models.
