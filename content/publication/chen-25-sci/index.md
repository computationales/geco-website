abstract: Persistent multiyear drought (MYD) events pose a growing threat to nature
  and humans in a changing climate. We identified and inventoried global MYDs by detecting
  spatiotemporally contiguous climatic anomalies, showing that MYDs have become drier,
  hotter, and led to increasingly diminished vegetation greenness. The global terrestrial
  land affected by MYDs has increased at a rate of 49,279 Â± 14,771 square kilometers
  per year from 1980 to 2018. Temperate grasslands have exhibited the greatest declines
  in vegetation greenness during MYDs, whereas boreal and tropical forests have had
  comparably minor responses. With MYDs becoming more common, this global quantitative
  inventory of the occurrence, severity, trend, and impact of MYDs provides an important
  benchmark for facilitating more effective and collaborative preparedness toward
  mitigation of and adaptation to such extreme events.
