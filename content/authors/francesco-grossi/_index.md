I am a visiting student from University of Milan. My thesis project involves the study of the ecosystem water balance using the P-model developed by the group and the Budyko curve.

Having mainly a molecular biology background, I am very fascinated by how plants directly influence the surroundings environment.

Dynamic vegetation modelling has always amazed me on how is possible to explain a natural phenomenon mathematically and how all the populations follows the same rule, from protein-protein interaction to ecosystems.

During my free time I like to cook, play football, and enjoy the natural landscapes.
