I am a master student doing the master program of Climate Sciences at the university of Bern and the Oeschgr Center. I am working in the group as a junior assistant. My background is in geography, informatics and biology.
 
When I am not doing research or studying I am a passionate photographer, traveler, climber and tea drinker.
