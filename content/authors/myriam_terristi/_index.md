I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (CEDI group led by Ana Bastos) in Jena, Germany and the Institute of Geography (GECO group led by Benjamin Stocker) at the University of Bern. 
My research is primarily focused on understanding land-climate dynamics, and the impacts of extreme climatic events on ecosystems using model simulations output and remote sensing data.
