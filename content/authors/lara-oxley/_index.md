I started my PhD journey in July 2024 as part of the Group High Latitude Biogeochemical Feedbacks led by Dr. Fabrice Lacroix and Prof. Stocker as my co-supervisor. My research focuses on the soil nitrogen released through the thawing permafrost in the Arctic region: using thaw depth data from CMIP6 models as well as soil nitrogen data, I will provide estimates of past and future changes to the pan-Arctic nitrogen budget. I will compare the amount of nitrogen released with estimates in nitrogen deposition and biological fixation. Furthermore, I will quantify the biologically available fraction of the nitrogen released from the permafrost and provide a first-order estimate on the consequences of this altered nitrogen cycling for Arctic vegetation biomass growth and CO2 uptake based on published results from nitrogen fertilization field experiments.

In my free time I love to go rowing, play music in my orchestra and spend time with friends.
